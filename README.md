# **TECHNICAL TEST**



This is the technical test I did for Celon Media Agency. The code has been entirely written by me, Macarena Sotomayor Fernandez-ayuso. The framework I used was Angular, and the programming language TypeScript. 

The project consists of two pages, Home, and Contact, located in the Pages folder of the project, along with Card, which is one of the components that appears as a child of Contact. 

The bulk of the Home page is composed of a table, located in Components/table, while Contact is located in the same folder (Pages/contact and Pages/Card) because at first the architecture was going to be different. 

The footer and the Menu appear in both pages, containing in the navbar of this one the links to navigate between them, in the project these routes are in the app-routing.module.ts and the components that conform it in the Shared folder.

On the other hand the interfaces and services have their own folder, being exported to the rest of the modules when necessary, as well as Assets, where any file related to the layout of the project has been saved. 

### REFERENCE #1

what is commented in this HTML file and in the .TS is an attempt of the section "select profile picture for the card" but I have not had time to finish it because I thought to do it from a back-end because I had understood that you asked that the user could upload the images from your pc, which is how I have done so far in the projects I have done, when I understood that you were referring to something else I have not had time to perfect it, I have been trying things that have not given the expected result and therefore I preferred to comment them.

### REFERENCE #2

this is a model for the functionality of downloading in .xlsx the component table that in the end I have not used, because I came up with a simpler way

### REFERENCE #3

with the function to select the users that are shown in the table according to their ID I am repeating code, I have not had time to make a function that includes all the ones I have used to get a more optimized code.
